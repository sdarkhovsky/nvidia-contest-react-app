# Generative AI Agents Developer Contest by NVIDIA and LangChain

The project was started to prepare a submission to the contest.
Initially I planned to come up with new algorithms related to Visual Large Language Models.
Then I refocused on creating a web application around a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
Pipeline with NVIDIA AI LangChain AI Endpoints as inspired by https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/tips-for-building-a-rag-pipeline-with-nvidia-ai-langchain-ai-endpoints

The project is supposed to let a Physical Therapist (PT) submit an image and ask PT related questions.
The Web Service would reuse a group of medical online sources to augment the questions and prepare better 
answers.

Unfortunately, my Web programming experience was not very extensive. I had to learn to use ReactJS for 
the front-end and NodeJS, ExpressJS for the back-end server. Currently the system is far from implementing
what was planned. But it's alive at https://nvidia-contest-react-app.onrender.com/

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
